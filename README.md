  # Studdies: Quick and easy connections for like-minded students

Studdies is a platform agnostic browser-based study connection tool. Search your topic and be connected to another student instantly on the platform of your choice. Easy, lightweight, no dedicated sign in and totally free.

Studdies was designed and implemented in 24 hours for RMIT's 2019 Hackathon: Connected Communities. Our challenge statement was to "ideate a digital solution that helps enable equal learning opportunities for everyone, everywhere".

Studdies currently works with Facebook, creating and connecting our first study community. Our roadmap involves expanding to Twitter, LinkedIn, Reddit, Canvas and more.
